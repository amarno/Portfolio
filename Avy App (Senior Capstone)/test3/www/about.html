        Some notes:
            * gap: is required only on iOS (when using UIWebView) and is needed for JS->native communication
            * https://ssl.gstatic.com is required only on Android and is needed for TalkBack to function properly
            * Disables use of inline scripts in order to mitigate risk of XSS vulnerabilities. To change this:
                * Enable inline JS: add 'unsafe-inline' to default-src
        -->

        <h2> About this app: </h2>

        <div id = "beacon" style= "padding-left: 8vw; padding-right: 8vw; padding-bottom: 3vh;">  
            <p> <span class="highlight"> This app was created to provide a resource for winter adventurers going into the backcountry. 
                This is not meant to replace any avalanche reporting or education, but to be used when there is no or limited reporting for the area being accessed.
                <br>
                <br> 

                The questions and ratings used in the Danger Rator are taken from Avalanche Canadaâ€™s Danger Rator. 
                The Danger Rator is not meant to be used in spring conditions, and it is not a flawless system. 
                It is only meant to help backcountry travelers make better decisions. 
                Always refer first to professional avalanche forecasting and reporting if possible.
