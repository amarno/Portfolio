        Some notes:
            * gap: is required only on iOS (when using UIWebView) and is needed for JS->native communication
            * https://ssl.gstatic.com is required only on Android and is needed for TalkBack to function properly
            * Disables use of inline scripts in order to mitigate risk of XSS vulnerabilities. To change this:
                * Enable inline JS: add 'unsafe-inline' to default-src

                    Have the person with the 'search' beacon start down the trail and stop at least 30 meters away </li><br>
                <li> <span class="highlight"> One at a time, have each person walk by the 'searcher'. 
                    The 'searcher' makes sure their beacon is getting an accurate signal from each passing person </li><br>
                <li><span class = "highlight"> If everyone has a properly working beacon, double check that everyone in the group is 'sending' and their beacons are 
                    secured to their bodies. Have a great adventure!
