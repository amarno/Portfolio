Avy App: The Avy App was my Senior Capstone Project. It is a simple Android App built with Cordova. The app is meant to help winter backcountry travelers make safer decisions in the mountains. I spend most of my free time in the winter and spring backcountry skiing so this project was a great intersection of my life in and out of the classroom. It was rewarding to build something that could have the potential to keep my community safer. 

Westminster Pride Store: The Pride Store project was web application built for the Westminster Pride Store. I worked with another developer and a designer to create an eccomerce that represented Westminster College and Pride. We build the store using Django, Python, SQLlite, and launched it with apache on a school server. Building the store from the ground up required us to implimenting designs, design the database, and work with a client to develop and deliver a working product. 

Watch Store: The watch store is a simple command line program and a SQL database. The program interacts with the database to query about products, prices, and customers. This project was done in a database specific class. It was a group project meant to demonstrate our ability to design, build, and query a database. 

Math Game: This was a group project in which we built a web app and game from the ground up throughout the entire semester. This was a significant assignment for me because while learning new languages and software I was also learning how to build a project with a team, build a product using agile methods, and design using user driven development. We launched our web app on AWS and used their REST APIs, databases, and sign-in tools. 
The goal of the project was to create a game that would teach 1st and 2nd graders simple addition and subtration. In addition we also created sign in functionality for both students and teachers so that teachers can keep track of their students progress, and students can see their work. 


The Chicken Clicker: A simple page that counts clicks. It is nothing special, but it is fun, a little bit creative, and shows shows a combination of CSS, JavaScript, and HTML
